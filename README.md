Privex's Postfix Log Parser + Web UI
=====================================

This is a small application designed to parse the log output of the Postfix SMTP server (usually `/var/log/mail.log`),
and convert it into easily queryable data inside of [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/).

It includes a Web UI built with [Quart](https://github.com/pgjones/quart) and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - allowing
for easily navigating and filtering the log data straight from your browser.

**DISCLAIMER:** The Web UI only includes a very basic password prompt which reads the password from the `.env` file.
This application is NOT intended to be public facing - we strongly recommend for production use-cases that it's
kept restricted within a corporate VPN / LAN.

There's also no requirement to run both the Web UI and the actual log parser/importer on the same server, as the
parsed data is kept in RethinkDB - thus you can run the WebUI on a separate server as long as it has access to the
RethinkDB server.

   EOF

   
   sudo yum install rethinkdb
   sudo cp /etc/rethinkdb/default.conf.sample /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d/instance1.conf
   # Edit directory = variable from /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d/instance1.conf (e.g: directory=/var/lib/rethinkdb/instance1/data)

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   EOF

   sudo systemctl enable rethinkdb\@instance1
   sudo systemctl start rethinkdb\@instance1
   sudo systemctl status rethinkdb\@instance1
   ```
 - Python 3.7 MINIMUM (will not work on earlier versions) + Pipenv (`python3.7 -m pip install pipenv`) - for creating a virtualenv + installing dependencies
    ```
    dnf install python39 python39-pip
    update-alternatives --config python3
    (Select python3.9)
    ```


**Install Process**
```
# (AS ROOT)
# User that will run the process
adduser mailparser

# To ensure that the parser is able to read the maillog, add the user to the appropriate groups
gpasswd -a mailparser adm
gpasswd -a mailparser postfix
chmod 640 /var/log/maillog
chown root:postfix /var/log/maillog

dnf install git

su - mailparser

git clone https://github.com/aleixsr/postfix-parser.git
cd postfix-parser

python3 -m pip install -U pipenv
pipenv install --python /usr/bin/python3
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

cp example.env .env
# Adjust the example .env as needed. Make sure you set SECRET_KEY to a long random string, and change ADMIN_PASS 
# to the password you want to use to log into the web application.
nano .env

# Add a crontab entry to run the parse/import script every minute or so
# You should use a file lock utility such as `flock` (included by default on Ubuntu) or `lckdo` to prevent the
# cron overlapping if there's a lot to parse.

crontab -e
# Uncomment when all is ok, confirm you have 'flock' installed also.
# *  *   *   *   *    flock /tmp/lck_mailparser /home/mailparser/postfix-parser/run.sh cron

####
# TEST
####

./run.sh parse       # Import MAIL_LOG immediately
# If all ok, remember to uncoment crontab -e line for mailpserser user!

./run.sh prod        # Run the server just to test if it works and binds ip and port correctly
# Go to http://you-server-ip-address:8487/ and type password set in .env file ADMIN_PASS value.


####
# PRODUCTION
####
Ctrl+C (to quit PROD execution)
exit (to quit mailparser session and login as root again)

# (AS ROOT)
# Production systemd service for the WebUI
install -m 644 /home/mailparser/postfix-parser/postfix-parser.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable postfix-parser.service
systemctl start postfix-parser.service
systemctl status postfix-parser.service

Here's the important parts:

 - If you use this software (or substantial parts of it) to run a public service (including any separate user interfaces 
   which use it's API), **you must display a link to this software's source code wherever it is used**.
   
   Example: **This website uses the open source [Privex Postfix Parser](https://github.com/Privex/postfix-parser)
   created by [Privex Inc.](https://www.privex.io)**
   
 - If you modify this software (or substantial portions of it) and make it available to the public in some 
   form (whether it's just the source code, running it as a public service, or part of one) 
    - The modified software (or portion) must remain under the GNU AGPL v3, i.e. same rules apply, public services must
      display a link back to the modified source code.
    - You must attribute us as the original authors, with a link back to the original source code
    - You must keep our copyright notice intact in the LICENSE.txt file

 - Some people interpret the GNU AGPL v3 "linking" rules to mean that you must release any application that interacts
   with our project under the GNU AGPL v3.
   
   To clarify our stance on those rules: 
   
   - If you have a completely separate application which simply sends API requests to a copy of Privex Postfix Parser
     that you run, you do not have to release your application under the GNU AGPL v3. 
   - However, you ARE required to place a notice on your application, informing your users that your application
     uses Privex Postfix Parser, with a clear link to the source code (see our example at the top)
   - If your application's source code **is inside of Privex Postfix Parser**, i.e. you've added your own Python
     views, templates etc. to a copy of this project, then your application is considered a modification of this
     software, and thus you DO have to release your source code under the GNU AGPL v3.

 - There is no warranty. We're not responsible if you, or others incur any damages from using this software.
 
 - If you can't / don't want to comply with these license requirements, or are unsure about how it may affect

**Legal Disclaimer for Contributions**

Nobody wants to read a long document filled with legal text, so we've summed up the important parts here.

If you contribute content that you've created/own to projects that are created/owned by Privex, such as code or 
documentation, then you might automatically grant us unrestricted usage of your content, regardless of the open source 
license that applies to our project.

If you don't want to grant us unlimited usage of your content, you should make sure to place your content

You should let us know in your pull request or issue that you've included files which are licensed
separately, so that we can make sure there's no license conflicts that might stop us being able
to accept your contribution.
